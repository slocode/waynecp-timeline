# Google Timeline

Not sure why I don’t have this in my notes.  

[Timeline](http://timeline.knightlab.com/#preview-embed) for Google.

The timeline in my Google Drive is [ here, WayneCP Timeline - Google Sheets](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1tEnix784MlBhufPiCF_frF5lpdIYl7Z8Khh8Q3AMMgY/edit#gid=0)

Follow the instructions from [here](http://timeline.knightlab.com/#preview-embed)

> ⚠️ Note that the site must be generated from this site.  I copied the iframe into a webpage in the waynecp_timeline.html document in the waynecp-timeline GitHub repo.

Page is also hooked.
