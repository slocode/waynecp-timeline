## This is the readme for my TimelineJS project.  

You can find more about the project here <http://timeline.knightlab.com/#preview-embed>  

The actual timeline is published at <https://waynecp.com/waynetimeline/waynecp_timeline.html> 

My Google Docs timeline file is located here <https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1tEnix784MlBhufPiCF_frF5lpdIYl7Z8Khh8Q3AMMgY/edit#gid=0>

 This is where I can continuously add entries to my timeline.
